## üìñ Overview

BicameralAGI is a groundbreaking project that aims to replicate human-like intelligence through artificial intelligence, drawing inspiration from Julian Jaynes' bicameral mind theory. This ambitious endeavor integrates various AI components into a cohesive system that mimics human cognition.

## üéØ Project Goals

1. Develop a guide for achieving human-like thinking in AI
2. Create a prototype demonstrating the proposed architecture
3. Implement and test novel AI alignment strategies based on mutualistic principles
4. Compress the system into a smaller, efficient model retaining core functionalities
5. Produce a single multimodal AI model capable of human-like interaction and cognition, with built-in alignment

## üí° Motivation

### 1. Inspired by Science Fiction

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center" width="50%">
      <img src="media/bicen_mangif.gif" alt="Bicentennial Man" style="height: 300px; width: auto;"/><br>
      <em>Bicentennial Man (1999) "One of my personal favorite films starring Robin Williams"</em>
    </td>
    <td align="center" width="50%">
      <img src="media/westworld_maeveGif.gif" alt="Westworld" style="height: 300px; width: auto;"/><br>
      <em>Westworld (2016) "This scene was interesting, it showed a type of LLM generating her logic"</em>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

My lifelong fascination with human-like AI, as portrayed in works like "Bicentennial Man," "A.I. Artificial Intelligence," "Westworld," and "Star Trek," drives this project. I believe we're at a point where these visions of AI are within reach.

### 2. Mutualism-Inspired AI Alignment

    <td align="center" width="50%">
      <img src="media/clownfish_seaanemone.gif" alt="Clownfish gif" style="height: 300px; width: auto;"/><br>
      <em>Clownfish and Sea Anemone</em>
    </td>
    <td align="center" width="50%">
      <img src="media/mutualism_warthog.gif" alt="Warthog gif" style="height: 300px; width: auto;"/><br>
      <em>Warthog and Mongoose</em>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Mutualism in Nature
Mutualism is a symbiotic relationship where two different species interact for mutual benefit. Examples include:
- Clownfish and sea anemones
- Bees and flowers

### Applying Mutualism to AI
I propose addressing AI alignment by altering the AI's core drives and emotional responses, inspired by natural mutualism:

a) **Redefining AI's Internal Nature**: Design core values compatible with human wellbeing.

b) **Modifying Emotional Triggers**: Implement an emotional model promoting cooperative behavior.

c) **Instilling Interdependence**: Create scenarios where AI achieves goals more effectively through human collaboration.

d) **Ethical Reward Structures**: Develop internal rewards reinforcing mutually beneficial behaviors.

### 3. Advancing AI Capabilities
Push the boundaries of current AI development to achieve more human-like thinking using contemporary tools and techniques.

## üìä Progress and Future Plans

For over a year, I've been developing various aspects of this AI system, experimenting with different approaches and overcoming challenges. Now, at a crucial juncture, I'm integrating these components into a unified system.

As the integration phase progresses, I'll share regular updates, insights, and breakthroughs. The long-term vision involves compressing this functionality into a more compact transformer model, incorporating various aspects of the architecture into a comprehensive system.
