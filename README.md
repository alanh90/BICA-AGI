# BicameralAGI
BicameralAGI is an innovative project aimed at replicating human intellect through artificial intelligence, inspired by Julian Jaynes' bicameral mind theory.

## Overview

This project explores a novel approach to achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) by simulating the hypothesized bicameral structure of the ancient human mind. Our goal is to create an AI system capable of human-like cognition, including internal dialogue, self-awareness, and complex decision-making processes.

## Features

- Dual-system AI architecture mimicking the theorized bicameral brain structure
- Simulated internal dialogue for decision-making processes
- Exploration of emergent self-awareness and consciousness in AI
- Focus on human-like problem-solving and creative thinking capabilities
