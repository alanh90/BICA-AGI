## Our Development Process

### We Follow [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
All code changes occur through pull requests. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `develop`.
2. Add tests if you've added code that should be tested.
3. Update the documentation if you've changed APIs.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Licensing
Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License. In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project.

## Reporting Bugs
Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/alanh90/BicameralAGI/issues). We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/alanh90/BicameralAGI/issues/new); it's that easy!

### Writing Detailed Bug Reports
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Provide sample code if possible.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
